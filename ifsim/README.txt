turn on beamfinder

center the dots
- use laser to center 2 dots as best as possible on the screen
- then mirror to put dots on top of each other
- and back to laser to re-center on screen

turn off beamfinder

make fringes
- use mirror pan adjust until fringes are seen
- maybe also use tilt adjust to make the fringes vertical
