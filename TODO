TODO
===============================================

clean up other TODO files and the ~/double_slit dirs
clean up emails
check protovantage order

check out how grounding works on my power supply, can + be grounded
get newest model raspberry pi with hardware for gpio pin access
wrtie s/w for rpi to read the gpio and count the pulses, start
 using sig gen directly as input, then go through the stretcher

start on the test box
- clean it out, and tape around it
- consider mounting it on a board, with the terminal block
- what connections are needed to the terminal block

sipm
- read through sipm sensor specs, and take notes
- make sipm directory, and keep notes on the sipm specs
- change name of pololu dir
- test sipm with oscilloscope

place order from amazon for ...
- breadboard 3.3v power 
- 9v power for the above
- utility knife blades
- metal epoxy

make slit for sensor, using knife blades, angle bracket, metal epoxy;
and test it

build the pulse stretcher and test with signal generator
- what is the length of the pulse, and amplitude

sensor mount
- draw a design diagram

check lowes for parts for the real setup
- box
  - wood for the box
  - more press in place caulk for the hole
  - perhaps some rubber insulation for the top
  - 4 wire cable, for the motor, maybe a couple of more wires for good measure;
    OR instead of extra wires in the cable, could make an extra hole or 2 and cover them
  - pvc flange and pipe  (3 or 4 inch ?)
  - pvc flange cap, for testing the box, may need 2, if one will be used for the test led
  - circular saw to cut the hole for the pvc pipe
- sensor mount
  - angle bracket
  - nylon screws
  - etc ...

the real sensor box
- make drawing, including the wiring
- make the box
- test for light leaks
- mount the rail and the sensor
- test the dark count rate in the box in lighted room and darkened room
- consider painting interior black
- include a low level light source in the box, such as a green led at 
  low voltage, and/or taped over with electrical tape;  this may be best mounted
  on a flange cap
  
the real double slit box
- tbd

rpi / gpio
- try using real time enhancements
- update dra_gpio.h to allow for setting pull up/down

- - - - - MAYBE LATER - - - - - - 

check into peltier cooling and eventually graph the dark rate based on cooling
- the cooler would be cooling the entire sensor box

stepper motor voltage ...
  http://blog.inventables.com/p/stepper-motors.html
  Stepper motors have a rated voltage and current.  
  A typical stepper motor like our NEMA 17 might have a rated voltage of 2.8 
  Volts and a maximum current of 1.68 Amps.  This basically means if you hook 
  it up to 2.8 Volts it will draw 1.68 Amps.  If you try to run it at a 
  higher voltage it will draw more current and get excessively hot.  
  Most people donâ€™t hook motors straight to a voltage source.  They use a 
  stepper motor driver.  Stepper motor drivers regulate the current.  
  If you hook it up to to 12V, for example, the motor while attempt to 
  draw more current, but the stepper motor driver will not allow that 
  to happen and use high frequency pulses to limit the average current 
  to the desired maximum value.

My controller
  https://www.pololu.com/product/3130     TIC T825
  It can operate from 8.5 V to 45 V and can deliver up to approximately 
  1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (or 2.5 A max 
  with sufficient additional cooling).

LOW RATE PHOTON GENERATION
===============================================

how many photons are emitted from a laser pointer
- http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/50455623/Momentum%20of%20a%20laser%20beam
- A laser pointer typically has a power rating of 1 mW, or 0.001 Joules per second. 
  This means that every second a laser pointer emits a number of photons equal to 
  (3.2x1018photons/J)(0.001J/s) = 3.2x1015 photons/s.

Red light lasers were once the standard, but lost its supremacy down the road. 
Red lasers lack the power and distance possible in newer models. Red lasers use 
diodes, optics, and various electronic components. Its wavelength is 630-680nm 
and its power is 5mW and below.
