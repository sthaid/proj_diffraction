Comparison of Feedback vs Bias voltage on U1
  Feedback Voltage = (3.3 - .7) / (1000 / 47) = 0.122 V = 122 mv
  Bias Voltage     = 3.3 / (10000 / 47)       = 0.015 V =  15 mv

Connection to GPIO

Performance Measurements
  The values in the above table were determined by reducing the SigGen
  amplitude to the point that the dra_pulse program (on the Raspberry Pi)
  stopped detecting the pulses at the expected frequency.

  Other SigGen Parameters
    Duty = 2 %
    Off  = 100 %

   Based on the above results, am using the 10K Bias R as of 2/12/2020

Some Problems Encountered
  I had difficulty getting rid of noise until I switched from a BNC cable
   to an oscilloscope probe measurement. 
  Connecting to GPIO, and also using the oscilloscope probe, needed a 
   resistor to stabilize the signal at the GPIO pin.
  When using the Raspberry Pi power supply, there were pulse counts 
   detected by the dra_pulse program when the SigGen was disabled. Fixed
   this by using the 9V battery connected to the Breadboard power supply.

Future Investigations TODO    
  1) Try voltage divider instead of single 1k resistor to GPIO pin.
  2) What voltage causes gpio to read '1'.
  3) what is the input resistance for the gpio.
  4) how does oscilloscipe probe work

stepper motor voltage ...
  http://blog.inventables.com/p/stepper-motors.html
  Stepper motors have a rated voltage and current.  
  A typical stepper motor like our NEMA 17 might have a rated voltage of 2.8 
  Volts and a maximum current of 1.68 Amps.  This basically means if you hook 
  it up to 2.8 Volts it will draw 1.68 Amps.  If you try to run it at a 
  higher voltage it will draw more current and get excessively hot.  
  Most people don’t hook motors straight to a voltage source.  They use a 
  stepper motor driver.  Stepper motor drivers regulate the current.  
  If you hook it up to to 12V, for example, the motor while attempt to 
  draw more current, but the stepper motor driver will not allow that 
  to happen and use high frequency pulses to limit the average current 
  to the desired maximum value.

My controller
  https://www.pololu.com/product/3130     TIC T825
  It can operate from 8.5 V to 45 V and can deliver up to approximately 
  1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (or 2.5 A max 
  with sufficient additional cooling).

LOW RATE PHOTON GENERATION
===============================================

how many photons are emitted from a laser pointer
- http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/50455623/Momentum%20of%20a%20laser%20beam
- A laser pointer typically has a power rating of 1 mW, or 0.001 Joules per second. 
  This means that every second a laser pointer emits a number of photons equal to 
  (3.2x1018photons/J)(0.001J/s) = 3.2x1015 photons/s.

Red light lasers were once the standard, but lost its supremacy down the road. 
Red lasers lack the power and distance possible in newer models. Red lasers use 
diodes, optics, and various electronic components. Its wavelength is 630-680nm 
and its power is 5mW and below.

  - comment:  ended up looking the amp up and found that the board uses a 
              INA-02186 Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit for the amp 
              and that specific chip has a typical voltage of 5.5v and a max 
              voltage of 7v. I am not sure if past versions used a different 
              chip but the one on mine clearly is not rated for the 
              advertised voltages.
- gain is 30 db
- .1 - 2000 MHZ
- someone suggested this is the component: https://www.qsl.net/n9zia/metricom/ina02184.pdf
  but I should confirm that
- I measured the voltage at the amplifier component pin and found it to be about
  5 V when the input is 12 Volts. This is because of the voltage drop across the
  bias resistor

3D PRINTING - ABS vs PLA materials
===============================================

https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/post-processing-fdm-printed-parts/

FDM = Fused Deposition Modeling

PLA and ABS are the 2 most common FDM desktop printing materials. 
Both are thermoplastics, meaning they enter a soft and moldable 
state when heated and then return to a solid when cooled. 
Via the FDM process, both are melted and then extruded through a 
nozzle to build up the layers that create a final part.

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a common thermoplastic 
well known in the injection molding industry. It is used for applications 
such as LEGO, electronic housings and automotive bumper parts.

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable (under the correct conditions) 
thermoplastic derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or 
sugarcane. It is one of the most popular bioplastics, used for many 
applications ranging from plastic cups to medical implants.

Generally the tolerances and accuracy of FDM printed components are 
largely dependent upon printer calibration and model complexity. 
However, ABS and PLA can be used to create dimensionally accurate parts, 
printing details down to 0.8 mm and minimum features down to 1.2 mm. 
For connecting or interlocking parts, a tolerance of 0.5 mm is 
recommended and using a minimum wall thickness of 1-2 mm will ensure 
adequate strength in wall elements.

3D PRINTING - SLA
===============================================

https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/introduction-sla-3d-printing/

SLA = Stereolithography 

In SLA, an object is created by selectively curing a polymer 
resin layer-by-layer using an ultraviolet (UV) laser beam. 
The materials used in SLA are photosensitive thermoset polymers 
that come in a liquid form.

If parts of very high accuracy or smooth surface finish are needed, 
SLA is the most cost-effective 3D printing technology available

SLA has many common characteristics with Direct Light Processing (DLP), 
another Vat Photopolymerization 3D printing technology. For simplicity, 
the two technologies can be treated as equals.

The liquid resin is solidified through a process called photopolymerization: 
during solidification, the monomer carbon chains that compose the liquid 
resin are activated by the light of the UV laser and become solid, creating 
strong unbreakable bonds between each other. The photopolymerization process 
is irreversible and there is no way to convert the SLA parts back to their 
liquid form: when heated, they will burn instead of melting. This is because 
the materials that are produced with SLA are made of thermoset polymers, 
as opposed to the thermoplastics that FDM uses.

Printer Parameters
- most print parameters are fixed by the manufacturer and cannot be changed
- input: layer height
- input: part orientation

The typical layer height in SLA ranges between 25 and 100 microns. 
Lower layer heights capture curved geometries more accurately but increase 
the build time (and cost) and the probability of a failed print. 
A layer height of 100 microns is suitable for most common applications.

Bottom Up / Desktop SLA
- dimensional accuracy:  +/- 0.010 to 0.250 mm
- support: 
  - Overhangs and bridges still need to be supported, 
  - minimizing the cross-sectional area of each layer 
    is the most crucial criterion: the forces applied 
    to the part during the peeling step may cause it to 
    detach from the build platform. 
    These forces are proportional to the cross-sectional 
    area of each layer. For this reason, parts are oriented 
    in an angle and the reduction of support is not a 
    primary concern.

Curling
- One of the biggest problems relating to the accuracy of parts 
  produced via SLA is curling. Curling is similar to warping in FDM.
- During solidification/curing, the resin shrinks slightly upon 
  exposure to the printer's light source. When the shrinkage is 
  considerable, large internal stresses develop between the new layer and 
  the previously solidified material, which results to curling of the part.

Curing:
- SLA parts must be post-cured, by placing them in a cure box under 
  intense UV light (and sometimes at elevated temperatures). This improves 
  greatly the hardness and temperature resistance of the SLA part but makes 
  it more brittle.
- Leaving the part in the sun will also induce curing. Extended exposure 
  to UV light has a detrimental effect in the physical properties and appearance 
  of an SLA part: they may curl, become very brittle and change color. 
  For this reason, spray coating with a clear UV acrylic paint before 
  use is highly recommended.

Materials                       PROS                     CONS
- Standard Resin            Smooth finish           Relatively Brittle
- Clear Resin               Transparent             Requires post processing
                                                      for a very clear finish
- Castable Resin            For creating mold
                              patterns
                            Low ash after burnout
- Touch or Durable Resin    ABS like mechanical     low thermal resistance

Post Processing
- https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/post-processing-fdm-printed-parts/
- sanding
- polishing
- spray coating
- finishing with a mineraloil

Benefits & Limitations of SLA
- Advantages:
  - very high dimensional accuracy and with intricate details
  - very smooth surface finish, making them ideal for visual prototypes.
  - speciality SLA materials are available, such as clear, flexible and castable resins.
- Disadvateges
  - generally brittle and not suitable for functional prototypes.
  - mechanical properties and visual appearance of SLA parts will degrade 
    overtime when the parts are exposed to sunlight.
  - support structures are always required and post-processing is necessary 
    to remove the visual marks left on the SLA part.

Specs for Desktop
- Dimensional Accuracy      .10 mm
- Build Size                145 x 14 x 175  mm
- Common Layer Thickness    25 - 100 microns    (.025 - .100 mm)
- Support                   essential to producing an accurate part

Rules of Thumb
- best suited for producing visual prototypes with:
  . very smooth surface and 
  . very fine details 
  from a range of thermoset materials.
- Desktop SLA is ideal for manufacturing small ("smaller-than-a-fist") 
  injection molded-like parts at an affordable price.
- Industrial SLA machines can produce very large parts (as big as 
  1500 x 750 x 500 mm).
