stepper motor voltage ...
  http://blog.inventables.com/p/stepper-motors.html
  Stepper motors have a rated voltage and current.  
  A typical stepper motor like our NEMA 17 might have a rated voltage of 2.8 
  Volts and a maximum current of 1.68 Amps.  This basically means if you hook 
  it up to 2.8 Volts it will draw 1.68 Amps.  If you try to run it at a 
  higher voltage it will draw more current and get excessively hot.  
  Most people donâ€™t hook motors straight to a voltage source.  They use a 
  stepper motor driver.  Stepper motor drivers regulate the current.  
  If you hook it up to to 12V, for example, the motor while attempt to 
  draw more current, but the stepper motor driver will not allow that 
  to happen and use high frequency pulses to limit the average current 
  to the desired maximum value.

My controller
  https://www.pololu.com/product/3130     TIC T825
  It can operate from 8.5 V to 45 V and can deliver up to approximately 
  1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (or 2.5 A max 
  with sufficient additional cooling).

LOW RATE PHOTON GENERATION
===============================================

how many photons are emitted from a laser pointer
- http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/50455623/Momentum%20of%20a%20laser%20beam
- A laser pointer typically has a power rating of 1 mW, or 0.001 Joules per second. 
  This means that every second a laser pointer emits a number of photons equal to 
  (3.2x1018photons/J)(0.001J/s) = 3.2x1015 photons/s.

Red light lasers were once the standard, but lost its supremacy down the road. 
Red lasers lack the power and distance possible in newer models. Red lasers use 
diodes, optics, and various electronic components. Its wavelength is 630-680nm 
and its power is 5mW and below.

Amplification Needed
--------------------

Dark Count Pulse
- Amplitude = 2 mv
- Needed for Pulse Stretcher:
  - 15 mv  to 3..3v
  - 5 ns
- the 5 ns should not be a problem

What DB gain is needed to get from 2 mv to:
- http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculatorVoltagePower.htm
- http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-amplification.htm
- Decibals:
  - doubling voltage is about 6db gain
  - doubling power is about 3db gain
- 15 mv  = 17 db gain
- 30     = 23 db gain
- 50     = 28 db gain
- 100    = 34 db gain
- 200    = 40 db gain

"More than one amplifier stage may be required to provide
 sufficient gain. A low noise 50 ohm voltage amplifier with
 a bandwidth of 1 GHz with a gain of 20 dB is suggested."
- A 2 mv + 20 db => 20 mv

"Figure 18. MicroFCâˆ’10020 Dark Pulse Shape. 
 Readout on Standard Output with 50  Series Resistor
 Connected to 2 x ZX60âˆ’43S+ Amplifiers in Series. Overvoltage = 5 V"
- This figure shows pulse amplitude of 200 mv, and 
  width at 50 mv of 25 ns

Looking for a Voltage Amplifier:
- 50 ohm
- bandwidth  1 Ghz
- gain      20 db

Coax connectors
- SMA     -  50 ohm
- F Type  - 75 ohm, commonly used with RG59U cable
- SMP     - sub miniature push on

ZX60âˆ’43-S+
- https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=ZX60-43-S%2B
- price is $70
- needs 5 vdc power
- connector is SMA
- 0.5 to 4000 MHZ   50ohm   SMA

- need to confirm supply voltage, it is either
  - 6-12 or
  - 5 typical, 7 max
  - comment:  ended up looking the amp up and found that the board uses a 
              INA-02186 Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit for the amp 
              and that specific chip has a typical voltage of 5.5v and a max 
              voltage of 7v. I am not sure if past versions used a different 
              chip but the one on mine clearly is not rated for the 
              advertised voltages.
- gain is 30 db
- .1 - 2000 MHZ
- someone suggested this is the component: https://www.qsl.net/n9zia/metricom/ina02184.pdf
  but I should confirm that
