WiringPi Sample Programs
- wpi_blink.c   - blink led on gpio-out 18
- wpi_switch.c  - switch led on gpio-out-18 based in gpio-in-25
- wpi_timing.c  - measure gpio-in-25 read rate

Bcm2835 Library Sample Programs
- bcm_blink.c
- bcm_switch.c
- bcm_timing.c

GPIO via Direct Register Access Sample Programs. 
These programs are based on info from:
    https://elinux.org/RPi_GPIO_Code_Samples#Direct_register_access
    https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=243846   
    (for the RPI4 Peripherals Base)
The dra_blink.h does not include all of the features from the sample
code at elinux.org. Not inlcuded is the ability to set pull up/down.
- dra_blink.c
- dra_switch.c
- dra_timing.c
- dra_pulse.c - counts pulses (rising edges), and prints the pulse rate

Results from the gpio input timing programs
===========================

[DS haid@ds gpio]$ sudo ./wpi_timing 
million_cnt/sec = 27.84
cnt=10000000  cnt_v_set=10000000

[DS haid@ds gpio]$ sudo ./bcm_timing 
million_cnt/sec = 11.09
cnt=10000000  cnt_v_set=10000000

[DS haid@ds gpio]$ sudo ./dra_timing 
million_cnt/sec = 64.45
cnt=10000000  cnt_v_set=10000000

Results from dra_pulse

  ------------- Signal Generator ----------          ------ DRA_PULSE ------
WAVE    VOLTAGE     OFFSET  DUTY    FREQUENCY     GPIO_READ_RATE    PULSE_RATE  (million/sec)

Square  3.3         100%    10%     1 MHZ              39           1.00
Square  3.3         100%    10%     1.3 MHZ            39           1.30
Square  3.3         100%    10%     1.5 MHZ            37           1.44 - 1.50

Summary: 
- The 1 MHZ frequency 10% duty cycle is a pulse width of 100 ns.
  This is the pulse width that needs to be measured; so the Raspberry Pi4 
  appears to meet my needs for detection of 100 ns pulses using GPIO.
- Start to have problems with the signal generator set to 1.5 MHZ. The 
  pulse width should be about 66 ns in this case; and the pulse rate should
  be 1.50 million/sec.
